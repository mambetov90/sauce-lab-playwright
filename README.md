# Sauce Labs Sample Application Test Automation Framework

## Objective

The objective of this framework is to create an automated test script that follows the provided test case for purchasing a T-shirt on the Sauce Labs Sample Application. The framework handles user authentication, page interactions, and validations during the end-to-end flow of the test scenario.

## Features

- End-to-end test automation for purchasing a T-shirt on the Sauce Labs Sample Application.
- Modular design using Playwright's fixtures to enhance reusability and maintainability.
- Robust page object model (POM) for interacting with application pages.
- Environment variable support for sensitive data (e.g., usernames and passwords).
- Custom fixtures for streamlined test setup and teardown.
- Integrated logging and reporting for better test analysis.

## Test Case

The framework automates the following scenario:

1. Navigate to the Sauce Labs Sample Application.
2. Log in with valid credentials.
3. Add a T-shirt to the shopping cart.
4. Proceed to checkout and provide the required information.
5. Verify the order summary and complete the purchase.
6. Validate that the order is successfully placed.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure the following:

1. **Install Node.js**
   Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v16+ is recommended).

2. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all the required dependencies using npm:
   npm install

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a .env file in the root directory and define the following variables:

   USER_NAME=<your_username>
   PASSWORD=<your_password>

5. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   npx playwright install

   ## Running Tests

   **Run All Tests**
   To execute the entire test suite, use:
   npx playwright test || npm run test:e2e

   ## Run Tests in Debug Mode

   To debug tests interactively:
   npx playwright test --debug

   ## View Test Report

   npx playwright show-report

6. **Install Allure Reporter**
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test allure-playwright

   ## install Allure CLI globally

   npm install -g allure-commandline

   ## generate Allure Report in allure results dir and create an output in allure-report dir

   allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean

   ## open Allure Report

   allure open allure-report

   ## Technologies Used

   - Playwright: End-to-end testing framework.
   - TypeScript: For better type safety and maintainability.
   - Dotenv: For handling environment variables.
